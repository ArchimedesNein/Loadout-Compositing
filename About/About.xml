	<description>Mix and match multiple 'tags' on a single pawn, allowing for composition of loadouts. Ever wondered why you couldn't just call your Planter/Melee pawn just that, and instead had to make one loadout with items from both in it? - No longer.
Mod Integrations:
- Better Workbench Management: When copying a bill which targets a tag to another bill, copy the tag with it.
- Pick up and Haul: Disable pick up patch from our side when PUAH is loaded (duplicate functionality).
Incompatibilies:
- Awesome Inventory: Both mods work in the same space, and will never be compatible. Sorry.
- Combat Extended: This mod will be integrated into Combat Extended replacing their existing loadout system in the near (ish) future

Credits:
- DrowsyCorgi ( NotooShabby ) for their incredible work on Awesome Inventory. I hope that it is visible the influence their mod has had; with regards to both the functionality of the mod, and the aesthetics of the GUI.  
- Madman666 for their work creating the custom textures which this mod uses
- All those who helped test, and gave feedback - it all helps
