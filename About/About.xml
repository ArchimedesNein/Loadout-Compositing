	<description>Mix and match multiple 'tags' on a single pawn, allowing for composition of loadouts. Ever wondered why you couldn't just call your Planter/Melee pawn just that, and instead had to make one loadout with items from both in it? - No longer.
Mod Integrations:
- Better Workbench Management: When copying a bill which targets a tag to another bill, copy the tag with it.
- Pick up and Haul: Disable pick up patch from our side when PUAH is loaded (duplicate functionality).
